My name is Tiew Chee Yan with matrix number, 22057371. I am majoring in Computer Science and Information Technology (Computer System and Network). This is my first time taking the Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling excited about taking this subject. This is because there might be a lot of fun and new things to explore and learn throughout these three and a half years.

I acquired A- for my previous Fundamentals of Programming 1 course. It's not too bad. So, I
