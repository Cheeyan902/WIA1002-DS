Q1: Describe the main difference between Queue and PriorityQueue.

Ans: Queue strictly follows the FIFO (First In First Out) order where the first 
element that gets removed is the first element that gets added first. However, Priority Queue does not strictly follow the FIFO order and the element that gets removed first has the highest priority regardless of the order.

Q2: Briefly provide THREE (3) real-life example in using PriorityQueue.

Ans: 
1. Boarding a flight, the first-class passengers and business class passengers get to board the plane before the economic class passengers.
2. Hospital emergency rooms, the patients with critical conditions should be prioritized and treated before those with less severe illnesses or injuries.
3. To-do lists, the tasks with higher priority or deadlines can be listed at the top to ensure they are completed first.

Q3: 
Part 1: peek() gives us: C++
Part 2: The queue elements: C++, Fortran, Java, Python
Part 3: After poll(): Fortran, Python, Java
Part 4: After remove(): Fortran, Python
Part 5: Priority contains Ruby or not?: false
Part 6: Value in array: Value: Fortran, Value: Python
        
Q4:
1. What is the purpose of the PriorityQueueComparator in the code?

Ans: The purpose of PriorityQueueComparator is to define a custom ordering method for the elements of the PriorityQueue. In this code specifically, it is used to compare two strings based on their length.

2. What is the output for the code?

Ans: Ali, Jason, Muhamad
