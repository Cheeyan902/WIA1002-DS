/* When the compiler encounters a generic class, interface, or method with an unbound type parameter, such as <T> or <E>, it replaces all occurrences of the type parameter with what type?
It does not replace the type parameter with any specific type. Instead, it leaves the type parameter unbounded and allows the user of the class or method to specify the type when the code is used. 
This is called "type erasure" and it allows for greater flexibility in the use of generic types.

Ans: Object.
